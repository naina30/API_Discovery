# API_Discovery
 A tool to help you intrusively discover all the publicly available endpoints for all the subdomains of a parent domain name. We use fuzzing for this and have created a custom wordlist to help bruteforce a substantial amount of probable scenarios. Can be modified for the better in the future so stay tuned!
